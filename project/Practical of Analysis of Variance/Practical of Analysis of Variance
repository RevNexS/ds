Theory: 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures 
(such as the "variation" among and between groups) used to analyse the differences among group means in a 
sample. 
ANOVA was developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher. In the ANOVA setting, the 
observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of 
variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether the population means of several groups 
are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test to more than two groups. 
ANOVA is useful for comparing (testing) three or more group means for statistical significance. It is conceptually 
similar to multiple two-sample t-tests, but is more conservative, resulting in fewer type I errors, and is therefore 
suited to a wide range of practical problems. 
Experiment using R (Two-Way ANOVA) 
A large company is assessing the difference in ‘satisfaction index’ of employees in finance, marketing & client-servicing 
dept. Experience Level is also considered as one factor in study.(lt5 - less than 5,gt5 - greater than 5). Do the variance 
testing ( ANOVA) for the same.
